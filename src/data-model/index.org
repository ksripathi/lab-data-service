* Introduction
  The application or the system is abstracted as the data model.  The model
  captures: the entities that comprise the system; relations and constraints
  between these entities; and operations that entail a change in the state of
  the system.

  The purpose of this document is to describe the expected behaviour of the lab
  data service. It is a specification for the requirements of this service.


* COMMENT LabId assigned for each lab

     Rules for assigning a LabId to a Lab
     1. LabId = discipline Id + number
     2. All the legacy lab ids will remain the same
     3. For a new lab, the number that is concatenated to the discipline Id is
        derived in the following way:
        - Fetch the labs in that particular discipline
        - Get the highest number
        - Increment it by one

*Note* - The legacy lab ids are not changed even if the given lab id
 does not match the discipline.

* Notation
  The system is defined as the data model.  There is a certain notation that is
  used for defining the data model. 

** Sets, cardinality and relations

If =A= is a set, then
    1. =A!= denotes exactly one element of =A=.
    2. =A?= denotes at most one element of =A=.
    3. =A+= denotes  one or more elements of =A=
    4. =A*=  denotes at zero or more elements of =A=.  Often
       abbreviated as =A=.

    5. =A > B= denotes a relation /from/ =A= /to/ =B=.

** Relations and their cardinality type

A relation =r:A > B= could relate each element of =A= to
zero, one or more elements of =B=.

|--------------------------------+-----------|
| Cardinality of B               | Notation  |
|--------------------------------+-----------|
| at least zero elements of =B=. | r: A > B  |
|--------------------------------+-----------|
| at most one element of =B=     | r: A > B? |
|--------------------------------+-----------|
| at least one element of =B=    | r: A > B+ |
|--------------------------------+-----------|
| exactly one element of =B=     | r: A > B! |
|--------------------------------+-----------|
   


* Informal abstraction of the data model

** Abstract Entity Types
  The following are the abstract data types in our system.
*** Lab
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: entity_lab
:END: 
  Requirement satisfied: [[../requirements/index.org::#lab][Lab]]
#+BEGIN_SRC spec :tangle spec.txt
;;; Entity Types

#+END_SRC
 
*** Experiment
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: entity_experiment
:END: 
  Requirement satisfied: [[../requirements/index.org::#experiment][Experiment]]
#+BEGIN_SRC spec :tangle spec.txt
;;; Entity Types
TYPE Experiment
#+END_SRC

*** Institute
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: entity_institute
:END: 
  Requirement satisfied: [[../requirements/index.org::#institute][Institute]]
#+BEGIN_SRC spec :tangle spec.txt

:END:

#+BEGIN_SRC spec :tangle spec.txt
;;; Entity Types

*** Developer
:PROPERTIES:

:END: 
  Requirement satisfied: [[../requirements/index.org::#developer][Developer]]

#+BEGIN_SRC spec :tangle spec.txt
;;; Entity Types
TYPE Developer
#+END_SRC


* Relations and cardinality constraints over entity types 
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: cardinal_constraints
  :END: 
  The constraints are defined both in terms of formal notation and also in
  diagrams for visual clarity. 

** Relations
   For each relation, we define its inverse next to it.
#+BEGIN_SRC spec :tangle spec.txt

* Keys

An entity =K= is called a /key for/ an entity =A= if there
is a relation =r: A? > K!=.

|----+------------+------------------|
|    | Entity     | Key              |
|----+------------+------------------|
| 1. | Lab        | lab_id           |
|----+------------+------------------|
| 2. | Experiment | exp_id           |
|----+------------+------------------|
| 3. | Institute  | name             |
|----+------------+------------------|
| 4. | Discipline | name             |
|----+------------+------------------|
| 5. | Developer  | name, email_id   |
|----+------------+------------------|

* Assumptions
* System state
  The system's state is captured by a set of /state variables/.

** Primary Entity sets
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: primary_entity_sets
:END:    
#+BEGIN_SRC spec :tangle spec.txt
;;; Primary state variables
Sets
  lab-set  : set[Lab]  ; set of all labs in the system

 #+END_SRC


** Derived Entity sets
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: derived_entity_sets
:END: 
#+BEGIN_SRC spec :tangle spec.txt
  question-set  : response-set.question  ; set of questions in the system
  answer-set    : response-set.answer    ; set of answers in the system
  response-set  : feedback-set.responses  ; set of all responses in the system  
  workshop-set : feedback-set.workshop  ; determine the workshop of each feedback identified 
                                        ; by IP and date.  The number of feddback elements in 
                                        ; the feedback-set that match a workshop determine the usage. 

  lab-usage-set      : feedback-set.exp_id ; set of all feedbacks of a lab
  exp-usage-set      : feedback-set.exp_id ; set of all feedbacks of an experiment in a lab

#+END_SRC


* Referential Integrity over primary and derived entity sets
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: referential_integrity_relations
:END: 
#+BEGIN_SRC spec :tangle spec.txt

 


#+END_SRC
  The relation =feedbacks : workshop-set > feedback-set += is ascertained by the
  fact that workshop-set is [[./index.org::#derived_entity_sets][derived entity set]].


* Operations 

CRUD operations.  

Each operation is performed on an entity instance or an
entity-set.   The operation may take additional parameters.

 - C  create a user      
 - R  read from a user   
 - U  update a user      
 - D  delete a user
