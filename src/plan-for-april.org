* Introduction
  - This document briefly explains plan for =April-delhi= meeting.
* Design
** Implemented and working APIs for Lab Data Service
   The [[https://github.com/vlead/lab-data-service/blob/develop/src/design/index.org][APIs]] for the lab data service have been implemented which enables us to
   search the labs with experiments,institutes,developers and discipline. The
   operations allowed for the admin user are adding labs, updating labs,
   searching labs etc which follows similarly for operations in
   experiments,institutes, developers and disciplines as well.

   The following APIs are being implemented. We are expecting a release on 15th
   Feb, 2017 with the following entitites :
   + [[https://github.com/vlead/lab-data-service/blob/develop/src/runtime/rest/api.org#get-labs-and-get-lab][Lab]]
   + [[https://github.com/vlead/lab-data-service/blob/develop/src/runtime/rest/api.org#get-experiments-and-get-experiment][Experiment]]

   + [[https://github.com/vlead/lab-data-service/blob/develop/src/runtime/rest/api.org#get-assets-and-get-asset][Asset]] - In progress
   + [[https://github.com/vlead/lab-data-service/blob/develop/src/runtime/rest/api.org#get-hostinginfos-and-get-hostinginfo][Hosting Information]] - In progress
   + [[https://github.com/vlead/lab-data-service/blob/develop/src/runtime/rest/api.org#get-integrationstatuss-and-get-integrationstatus][Integration Status]] - In progress

* Plan (Feb, 2017 [[https://github.com/vlead/lab-data-service/milestone/2][Milestone 2]])
  This milestone describes the task of lab specification creation for the lab
  metadata across all the 180+ labs hosted on different Virtual-Labs
  platforms. The lab specifications would consist all the information 
  related to a lab/experiment as per the design of Lab Data Service. The task
  has been given to the Research Assistants team comprising of 3 members.

  Implementing the above plan will result into the following -
  + Labs and experiments as services. [[https://github.com/vlead/lab-data-service/blob/master/src/index.org][Github repository]] link for the same.
  + Able to search and get the updated info about any lab by
    experiments,institutes,developers etc.
  + The APIs could be served to other services for resource IDs and fetching
    information about labs.
  + Dynamic serving of the lab data using content server on any hosting
    platform like Open Edx, Moodle etc.
